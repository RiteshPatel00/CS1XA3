## Referenced Code

Creative CV is a HTML resume template for professionals. Built with Bootstrap 4, Now UI Kit and FontAwesome, which contains a modern design. It also contains CSS templates that gives the webpage a better aesthetic. Most of the code templates are from Creative CV, original work is included in the Custom Javascript file which uses jQuery to make some cool animations and functionality.


## Custom Javascript Code

Feature #1 Mouse Event: Smooth mouse scrolling

Feature #2 When scrolling animate the HTML and CSS elements by causing an animate event

Feature #3 Form event is used if the user decides to resize the webpage and change the form in order to either fit it on to a smaller device such as mobile or tablet. This is untested for the most part but works well on a PC.
